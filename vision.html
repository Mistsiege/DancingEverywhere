		<p>There is something special about dancing that connects people. It transcends city limits, ethnicity, religion, even economic status. Dancing is an incredibly powerful form of self expression, movement, and conversation, and it is all over the world. At Dancing Everywhere we want to create a worldwide connection between all communities of people who express themselves through dance. Imagine a scenario: You travel across the world to a city full of strangers. You know no one, and in conversing with those strangers you may be happy to shake hands with someone who shares your profession, religious background, or ethnic identity. But when you meet a dancer, suddenly you share a passion, a connection, a community, even a language with those strangers. What if everyone you met was a dancer? What if there was Dancing Everywhere?</p>

		<h2 class="center"> - We have a Vision: to connect the global dance community with non-dancers - </h2>
		<p>We work hard to grow our local dance communities. But it is not enough. It is time to extend an invitation to dance to the world, to show everyone how unifying dance truly is and how accessible it is to everyone, Everywhere.  Some sites, like <a href="http://www.dancecal.com">DanceCal</a>, show the dance community where to find exchanges and workshops. Our site, DancingEverywhere, shows the global community where to find dance. Our vision is to create a map of ALL dancing in the world</p>

		<h2 class="center"> - Our Goal is to see Dancing Everywhere - </h2>
		<p>Simple.  Straightforward.  However, systems that span the entire globe are not created overnight.  We need the support of the global dance community to help us populate this site with the information needed to create this vision.  We also need your support and constructive feedback for the systems we develop, so that we may help you share your passion in a way that fits your needs and wants.</p>
